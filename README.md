The Intelligent Safety Surveillance System (ISSS)
for Industrial Environments is a comprehensive solution
designed to enhance workplace safety by monitoring Personal
Protective Equipment (PPE) compliance and detecting worker
drowsiness. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning
technologies, the ISSS provides real time monitoring and
proactive alerting mechanisms. This system employs
strategically positioned cameras to detect and recognize PPE
items such as helmets, safety masks, and gloves. Deep learning
algorithms analyze video feeds to identify instances of non compliance, triggering immediate alerts to workers and
supervisors for corrective action. In addition to PPE compliance
monitoring, the ISSS utilizes cameras equipped with infrared
sensors to monitor workers' facial expressions and eye
movements for signs of drowsiness. Machine learning models
are trained to recognize patterns indicative of drowsiness, such
as drooping eyelids or prolonged eye closure. Upon detecting
these signs, the system alerts workers and supervisors,
mitigating the risk of accidents caused by fatigue-related errors.
By combining advanced technologies with proactive safety
measures, the ISSS aims to create a safer work environment in
industrial settings. Its ability to detect non-compliance and
drowsiness in real-time enables timely intervention, ultimately
reducing the risk of workplace accidents and injuries
